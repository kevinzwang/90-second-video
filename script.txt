When programming a large project, especially one that involves collaboration with other coders, things get messy really fast. Syncinc versions, keeping track of bug fixes, and reverting to specific changes all get increasingly hard to do with simply google docs or sharing text files with eachother. 

That is where version control comes in. The most popular form of version control is Git, so that's what I'll talk about today. 
Thanks for watching!
